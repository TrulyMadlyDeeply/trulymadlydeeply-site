                <h3>Do you offer personalised gifts?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, we offer a range of personalised gifts. On Amazon, some items include personalisation options
                    in the listing, while others provide personalisation instructions in the product description. We
                    check the details, and if anything is unclear we will contact you before it is produced.
                </p>

                <h3>How do I provide personalisation details?</h3>
                <p>
                    If the listing does not offer personalisation fields during checkout, you can still provide details
                    using one of these methods:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>During checkout</strong>, use Amazon's <strong>Gift message</strong> box to enter your
                        personalisation. Amazon may require a "From ..." line, we normally ignore that unless you ask us
                        to include it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>After checkout</strong>, message us using Amazon's <strong>Contact seller</strong> /
                        <strong>Message the seller</strong> option and include your personalisation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we have not received your personalisation, <strong>we will contact you</strong> to request it
                        before anything is produced.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Whichever method you use, we will work with you to make sure the personalisation is exactly as you
                    want it.
                </p>
