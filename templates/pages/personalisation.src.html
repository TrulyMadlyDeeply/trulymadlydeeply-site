        <p class="section-intro">
          If your item is personalised, we check your details carefully. If anything is unclear, we contact you before
          it is produced.

            <h3>1) Use Amazon’s Gift message box during checkout</h3>
            <p>
              During checkout, you can usually find a <strong>Gift message</strong> option. Enter your personalisation
              there. Amazon may force a “From …” line, we normally ignore that unless you ask us to include it.

            <h3>2) Message the seller after checkout</h3>
            <p>
              After ordering, you can use Amazon’s <strong>Contact seller</strong> or <strong>Message the
                seller</strong>
              option. Send your personalisation details in the message.
            </p>

            <h3>3) If we do not receive your details, we will contact you</h3>
            <p>
              If we have not received your personalisation, we will message you to request it. We do not produce
              personalised items with unclear details.

        <div class="panel">
          <h2>Do all listings collect personalisation during checkout?</h2>
          <p>
            No. Some Amazon listings have dedicated personalisation fields, and some provide instructions in the product
            description. Either way, we can still receive your details using the methods above.
          </p>

          <h2>Will you confirm my personalisation?</h2>
          <p>
            If anything looks unclear or incomplete, we will contact you to confirm. Our aim is to make sure you are
            happy with the final result.
          </p>

          <h2>How quickly should I send my personalisation?</h2>
          <p>
            As soon as possible after ordering. If you are not ready yet, let us know, we can hold production until the
            details are confirmed.
